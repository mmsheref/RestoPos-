# RestoPos - Quick Start Guide

This guide provides a brief overview of the main features of your high-performance Restaurant POS system.

## 1. The Sales Screen (Your Home Base)
This is where all transactions happen.
-   **Adding Items:** Simply tap an item from the grid to add it to the ticket on the right. Tapping the same item consecutively will increase its quantity on the last line.
-   **Custom Grids:** Use the tabs at the bottom to switch between your custom menus (e.g., "Breakfast," "Drinks"). You can manage these grids in **Settings**.
-   **Saving a Ticket:** If a customer needs to step away, tap the "Save" button on the ticket. You can use the "Quick Select" table names for speed.
-   **Loading a Ticket:** Tap "Open Tickets" to see all saved orders, ready to be loaded or deleted.

## 2. Completing a Sale
-   Tap the **"Charge"** button at the bottom of the ticket.
-   **Payment Screen:**
    -   **Cash:** Use the large on-screen numpad for fast entry. The "Exact Cash" button is a one-tap solution. The system automatically calculates change.
    -   **Other Methods (UPI, Card, etc.):** Tap the corresponding button to process an exact-amount payment. You can configure these methods in **Settings**.
    -   **Split Payments:** You can add multiple payment lines (e.g., part cash, part UPI) and the system will auto-balance the remaining amount.

## 3. Managing Your Restaurant
-   **Items Page:** Add, edit, and delete your menu items. You can upload compressed images directly from your device. Use the "Import" and "Export" buttons to manage your menu via CSV files.
-   **Receipts Page:** A complete history of all your transactions. It features a fast, searchable interface with infinite scroll. You can select any receipt to view its details and reprint it.
-   **Settings Page:** This is the control center.
    -   **Appearance:** Switch between Light and Dark modes.
    -   **Payment Types:** Add or disable custom payment methods.
    -   **Tables:** Manage the list of table names used for the "Quick Select" feature.
    -   **Printers:** Configure your Bluetooth thermal printers.
    -   **Data Management:** Create a full backup of your app data or restore from a file.

## 4. Key Features to Remember
-   **Offline First:** The app is fully functional without an internet connection. All sales and changes are saved locally and sync automatically when you're back online.
-   **Instant Navigation:** Switching between screens is instantaneous, with no lag or jitter, making for a smooth workflow.
